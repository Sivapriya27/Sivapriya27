Hi there! 👋  
I'm **Sivapriya Gopi** — part technologist, part research nerd, full-time ML/Data Lover  🧙‍♀️💻  
Currently decoding neurons by day 🧠 and data patterns by night 🌙

🎓 Doing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at the University of Minnesota 🏫 

🎓 Graduated **with First Class Distinction** in B.Tech CSE from SRM University in India 🇮🇳

🧠 I'm a **Graduate Research Assistant** at UMN Neuroscience Dept., building software and analyzing data to help treat neurogenic damage. Yes, I play with patient data. Responsibly! 😇

🚀 Interned as a Software Dev at **Softlogic Systems**, crafting payroll systems with Java + Spring Boot like a backend wizard 🪄 — boosted performance, added OAuth, and made databases feel alive.

📊 Into all things **Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Generative AI** (aka, I love when machines try to be smart — sometimes smarter than me 👀)

👩‍💻 Projects I had way too much fun with:
- 📰 **News Headline Classifier** – 87% accuracy (the news couldn’t fool me)
- 🧠 **Crime Prediction Model** – 91% accuracy (I swear, no psychic powers involved)
- 🤖 **AI Pursuit Game** – Robots that chase you using A*, because why not?
- 📈 **Stock Sentiment Analyzer** – Built with Svelte, because even stocks have feelings
- 💰 **Personal Finance Tracker for Students** – Budgeting made bearable
- 🌍 **SettleUp** – Helping international students survive (and thrive!)

🖥 Currently diving deeper into ML, Data Analytics and Gen AI

❓ Ask me about machine learning, neuroscience collabs, AI humor, or how I survive code + chocolate milkshake 🥤✅
